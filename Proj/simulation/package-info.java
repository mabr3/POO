/**
 * Package that contains the items related with the simulation structure, i.e., the abstract class for the grid and our implementation of it, the Point class and the Edge.
 * Also, an interface for the simulation class and the implementation used, making it possible to change both the grid and the simulation class.
 * 
 * The Observation event is related to a simulation, therefore it is also present here, as well as the XML class, which is used to get the information
 * needed from the XML file.
